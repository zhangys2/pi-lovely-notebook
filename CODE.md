# Pi notebook monorepo

Tools for safe `.ipynb` inspection and editing, exposed as a Pi extension and as a
local stdio MCP server over one shared core.

## Layout

Bun workspace (`workspaces: ["packages/*"]`), three independently published `@xl0` packages:

- `packages/core` — `@xl0/lovely-notebook`: notebook JSON logic + adapter-neutral tool layer.
  No Pi/MCP imports; only runtime dep is `typebox` (peer).
- `packages/pi` — `@xl0/pi-lovely-notebook`: Pi extension adapter; core + Pi peers.
- `packages/mcp` — `@xl0/lovely-notebook-mcp`: stdio MCP server; core + MCP SDK + typebox.

Thin adapters keep the Pi and MCP dependency trees isolated. Root `package.json` sets
`pi.extensions: ["./packages/pi/extensions"]` so Pi sessions in this repo dogfood the extension.

Root `README.md` is the project entry point; each package carries its own npm-facing
`README.md` + `LICENSE` (MIT) and full npm metadata, plus `bun run release` to publish it.

Publishing is built, because node refuses to strip types under `node_modules`
(`ERR_UNSUPPORTED_NODE_MODULES_TYPE_STRIPPING`) — shipping source alone made `npx` installs
bun-only, which is the wrong bet for an MCP server. `bun run release` builds first:

- core: `bun build --target node` ESM + `tsgo -p tsconfig.build.json` declarations. Its `exports`
  keeps a `bun` condition pointing at `src/`, so bun (and everything in this repo) still runs the
  TypeScript directly and no build is needed for development. Root tsconfig sets
  `customConditions: ["bun"]` so typecheck resolves `src/` too, not the unbuilt `dist/*.d.ts`.
- mcp: one `dist/bin.js` bundle from `src/bin.ts`, SDK/typebox/core external. `bin.ts` exists so
  the published entry connects the transport without an `import.meta.main` guard — bun compiles
  that to `__require.main`, which throws under node.
- pi: source only. Pi is a bun app and loads TypeScript extensions directly.

## Core

`packages/core/src/notebook.ts` — pure notebook JSON operations, no I/O beyond load/save.

- nbformat 4 only; cell types `code`, `markdown`, `raw`.
- On parse everything is normalized to typed internal shapes: source and stream `text` to one
  `string`, metadata to a typed object, attachments to typed MIME bundles, outputs to a typed
  union (unknown output fields preserved).
- Save reproduces Jupyter's canonical form byte for byte: keys sorted at every level, 1-space
  indent, `source` and stream `text` back to `string[]`, trailing newline. Same rules as
  nbformat's `JSONWriter` (`sort_keys=True`) and VSCode's `sortObjectPropertiesRecursively`.
  Without this a one-cell edit rewrote ~770 lines of a 13k-line notebook and buried its own diff.
  Mime-bundle and attachment values are never re-split, since parsing leaves them untouched;
  nbformat would split `text/*`, `application/javascript` and `image/svg+xml`.
- The input file's indent and line ending are detected on parse and reused on save (Jupyter
  writes 1 space, Colab 2; Windows autocrlf checkouts are CRLF), kept in a `WeakMap` keyed by the
  notebook so they never reach the file. VSCode does the same for indent via `detectIndent` plus
  in-memory `indentAmount` metadata.
- Helpers take 0-based indexes only; selector resolution lives in the tool layer.
- Id policy: no-id notebooks stay no-id, missing ids are never backfilled, inserted cells
  get ids only when the notebook already uses ids or `nbformat_minor >= 5`.
- Summary format: one `meta` line, then a pseudo-XML `<cell>` element per cell (with `atts=`,
  `n_exec` when present, `id` only when stored) containing its source preview and one `<output>`
  element per output MIME variant. Elements self-close only when genuinely empty (image-only
  output variants), so preview text that looks like markup — Python reprs such as
  `<module.Class>` are the common case — cannot be read as structure. Containment is why output
  elements carry no `cell_id`.
- `notebook_read_cell_output` on a rich output with no `mime` uses the same element shape, one
  `<output mime=...>` per variant; image and empty variants self-close, which also tells the
  model an image existed under `includeImages: false`.
- `image/svg+xml` is an image whose payload is text: it self-closes like any image instead of
  dumping thousands of markup lines into a default read, and is returned as text (paginated)
  only when requested by mime. As attachment content it goes out as text either way — sent as
  image content it would just fail the host's resizer with a misleading size note — decoding
  base64 when it is stored that way, which is what JupyterLab does with pasted images.
- `outputIndex` is optional: omitted means the cell's only output, and more than one output is an
  error naming the count, never a silent pick. 94% of output-bearing cells in the fixtures and
  the lovely-tensors/lovely-numpy notebooks have exactly one output.
- Two conventions, deliberately distinct: pseudo-XML elements for structure, `[...]` notes for
  inline or appended annotations (`[image: mime/type]`, `[N more lines]`, `[Image omitted: ...]`)
  that never claim to contain anything.
- Previews (source and output alike) are bounded three ways: 5 lines with a `[N more lines]`
  marker, 500 chars per line, and `data:` image URIs replaced by `[image: mime/type]` — one
  embedded image is a single line, so the line cap alone does not bound it. `sourceLines` still
  counts raw source, so `lines=` stays consistent with read pagination.
- `sliceCellSource` is the single gate every returned text passes through — cell source, output
  text, SVG attachment markup, formatted summary. Reads are capped at 2000 lines *or* 50KB
  (pi's Read tool bounds), even when the caller passes a larger `lineLimit`: one base64 or
  minified line is megabytes, so a line count alone bounds nothing. Truncation always ends in
  the offset to continue from; a single over-budget line is cut mid-line (on a code point
  boundary) and says so, since no offset can resume inside a line.
- Line offsets are 1-based, like every file read tool a model already knows (pi, Claude Code,
  lovely-ide); cell and output indexes stay 0-based as in nbformat. Both are spelled out in the
  schemas and in the shared guidelines, and truncation notes quote the exact offset to pass back.
  Pi's `path:start-end` read header assumed 1-based line numbers all along.
- An empty slice (empty source, offset at the end, `lineLimit: 0`) returns `[Empty]` or
  `[No lines at offset N: ...]`. Tool content with no text at all reads as a failure.
- ANSI escape codes are stripped from stream and error text on read (summary and output reads);
  the file keeps them, since Jupyter renders them.
- `searchNotebook` returns one `<cell>` element per matching cell with `line: text` entries,
  1-based so they feed straight into a read's `lineOffset`. Sources only, not outputs.

`packages/core/src/tools.ts` — runners + typebox schemas; `src/index.ts` re-exports both.

- Each tool exports one `{ name, description, params, run }` descriptor; adapters and tests
  use that single symbol.
- Schemas are colocated with their runner and never shared. String enums go through a local
  `StringEnum` helper so providers see `type: "string"` + `enum` rather than `anyOf`/`const`.
- `mutateNotebook(path, mutate)` consolidates load → mutate → save.
- Source-changing runners take an optional second arg `onChange({before, after})`, called with
  the touched cell's source only after the save succeeds (insert: empty before; delete: empty
  after; merge: the anchor). MCP ignores it.
- `applyExactSourceEdits` follows pi's edit tool: unique matches, no empty `oldText`, no overlaps,
  must change something. No whitespace-fuzzy fallback (pi has one; we stay exact).
- Runners return `NotebookToolContent` (`{type:"text"}` / `{type:"image", data, mimeType}`),
  MCP-shaped and structurally Pi-compatible. Images are raw base64; resizing/capping is
  an adapter concern.
- Also exported for adapters: `notebookToolGuidelines`. Paths are used as given; resolving them
  is the adapter's job, since each host defines cwd differently.

Tools: `notebook_summary`, `notebook_search`, `notebook_create`, `notebook_read_cell`, `notebook_write_cell`,
`notebook_change_cell_type`, `notebook_edit_cell`, `notebook_insert`, `notebook_delete`,
`notebook_move`, `notebook_merge`, `notebook_clear_outputs`, `notebook_read_cell_output`,
`notebook_read_cell_attachment`. All but summary and search are single-cell and accept `cellId`
or 0-based `index` (`notebook_insert.index = -1` appends).

Notable tool semantics: `notebook_create` writes with `wx` so an existing path fails with EEXIST
in the kernel, never through a check-then-write window — replacing a notebook with an empty one
destroys every cell and output. It writes `language_info.name` (a language
like `python`, not a kernel name like `python3`) while leaving `kernelspec` to the editor; read returns raw source only (metadata is
summary-only); markdown `data:` URI images become `[image: mime/type]` markers plus image
content; type changes clear fields invalid for the target type.

Merge requires an adjacent same-type cell and keeps the anchor's id, metadata and outputs. Both
cells' attachments are unioned, as JupyterLab does, because the merged source keeps every
`attachment:key` reference; a key claimed by both with different payloads is refused rather than
picked. The removed cell's outputs go with it (VSCode's join does the same, JupyterLab drops both
cells' outputs) and the count is reported, since nothing else would show the loss.

## Adapters

`packages/pi/extensions/notebook/index.ts`

- Table-driven registration: one `notebookTools` entry per core tool holding label, prompt
  snippet, render style; names/descriptions come from the core descriptors.
- Shared tool semantics live once as namespaced guidelines on `notebook_summary`.
- A `tool_call` hook blocks built-in `read`/`edit`/`write`/`grep` whose `path` or `glob` ends in
  `.ipynb`, with a reason naming the notebook tools. Guidelines alone didn't stop models reading
  escaped JSON or editing it past every structural check. `bash` is left alone.
- Relative paths resolve against `ctx.cwd`. No `@`-mention stripping (pi's own path tools still
  do it via `stripAtPrefix`; current models don't need it).
- Every tool runs under `withFileMutationQueue(normalizedPath, ...)` — reads too, since Pi
  executes tools in parallel.
- Write, edit, insert, delete and merge render a source diff with Pi's standard diff UI, built
  from the core `onChange` callback, so the notebook is loaded once per call. Type change, move
  and clear-outputs leave source untouched and keep their text result.
- `resolveContentImages` runs core images through Pi's `resizeImage`; unresizable ones become
  `[Image omitted: ...]` notes.

`packages/mcp/src/server.ts` (`bun packages/mcp/src/bin.ts`, or the `lovely-notebook-mcp` bin)

- Low-level SDK `Server` with `tools/list`/`tools/call`; typebox schemas pass through verbatim
  as `inputSchema`, args checked with `Value.Check`; failures return `isError` text.
- One global promise-chain queue: every tool call runs to completion before the next starts.
  Calls are short single-file read-parse-writes, so this costs nothing and preserves call order.
- Relative paths resolve against the server process startup cwd.
- No resizer: images above 4MB base64 become omission notes.

## Tests and tooling

- `bun test` at root: 104 tests, green.
- `.gitattributes` forces LF on checkout: biome requires it, and fixtures are byte-exact save oracles.
- `packages/core/test/notebook-core.test.ts` covers parse/validation, pure ops, formatting,
  load/save roundtrips. One `notebook-*.tool.test.ts` per tool, one
  `notebook-*.workflow.test.ts` per multi-step flow.
- `packages/pi/test/` covers the resize/omission seam and source diffs;
  `packages/mcp/test/queue.test.ts` covers realpath/symlink serialization.
- Fixtures in `packages/core/test/fixtures/`, including `subtly-corrupt-images.ipynb`
  (valid-looking PNG base64 with undecodable IDAT) to pin the raw-vs-omitted image split.
- `bun run tool -- <tool-name> '<json-args>'` prints raw tool output without launching Pi.
- `bun run check:notebooks [root]` runs the whole core against every `.ipynb` under a tree
  (default: this repo's parent), on copies: parse, summary, cell/output/attachment reads, then a
  save that must not lose content, churn a canonical file, or reformat unstably. 312 real
  notebooks (nbformat 4.0-4.5, 136MB) pass in ~3s.
- `bun run check` = `tsgo --noEmit` + `biome check`. Biome 2.4.14, git-aware, 140 cols, tabs,
  LF, semicolons as needed. tsconfig is strict (`noUncheckedIndexedAccess`,
  `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`, `noPropertyAccessFromIndexSignature`, ...) and uses `bun-types`.

## Dependency handling

- Pi core packages stay in `peerDependencies` at `"*"` per Pi package docs; registry
  `pi-coding-agent`/`pi-tui` `^0.80.10` sit in devDependencies for typechecking.
- `bun run link:pi` overlays `node_modules/@earendil-works/*` with symlinks to
  `../pi-mono/packages/*` using raw `rm`+`ln -s` (npm link cannot parse bun workspace trees).
  Rerun after `bun install`.
- `bunfig.toml` pins `linker = "hoisted"` so that overlay has one target location.
- `typebox` is pinned to exactly `1.1.38` — the version pi bundles. Hoisting then unifies it
  with the linked pi-mono packages; a different root version makes `bun install` attempt nested
  installs inside the read-only link targets.

## Decisions

ADRs in `docs/adr/`. Core stays pure and adapter-free; publish core once and keep Pi/MCP thin.
Notebook JSON is parsed directly, no nbformat dependency. Tools are one-cell-at-a-time with dual
cellId/index selectors. Outputs are preserved on mutation. No `NotebookSession` abstraction —
`mutateNotebook` covers the only real backend (disk).

## Gaps

- Text reads are bounded, but byte truncation slices JavaScript characters rather than UTF-8
  bytes. Non-ASCII single lines can exceed the 50KB ceiling and report a negative remaining-char
  count. SVG attachment reads now support line slices and continuation offsets.
- Verification: tests, direct Pi tool calls on a copied fixture, `bun run tool` smoke runs, a
  stub-`ExtensionAPI` registration check, and a full pass of all 13 tools through Claude Code
  against the MCP server (reads, mutations, images, attachments, error paths, concurrent calls).
  The server is registered with Claude Code at local scope for dogfooding, not in the repo.
- Not published to npm yet; READMEs already document the npm install paths. Publish core first
  so the `^0.1.0` core dep in the Pi/MCP packages resolves.
- Pi surfaces raw schema-validator messages instead of friendly allowed-value hints.
- Notebooks not already in Jupyter's canonical form are reformatted once on first save.
- No-id notebooks depend on index selectors.
- Execution is not implemented; see `PLAN.md`.
